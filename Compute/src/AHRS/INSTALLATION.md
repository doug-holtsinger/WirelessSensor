pxd file 
Cython uses .pxd files which work like C header files â€“ they contain Cython declarations 
(and sometimes code sections) which are only meant for inclusion by Cython modules. A pxd file is 
imported into a pyx module by using the cimport keyword.

pyx
Cython source code

setup.py
Like a Makefile for Cython
