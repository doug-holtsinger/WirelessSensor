Wireless Sensor Hobbyist Project using a Nordic nRF52840

TODO:
1) Refine calibration, remove fixed constants
2) Fix singularity at North Pole, can't get to 90 degree pitch
3) Further testing
4) Re-organize all code
5) Visualization 
6) Re-enable BLE
7) BLE application
8) Battery Power
9) Prototype Board 
10) Remove requirements for Serial Port and SEGGER Debugger for general use
11) Calibration Storage, so you don't have to do calibration every time you power on
